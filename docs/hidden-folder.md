The Hidden folder is a synthetic category that:
- **Automatically populated** with bookmarks that have passcode protection
- **Cannot be deleted** or modified like regular categories
- **Visually distinct** with a special gradient design and lock icon
- **Secure access** - only shows bookmarks you have access to
